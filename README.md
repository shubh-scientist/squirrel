Squitra- A Squirrel Tracker Web App

This squirrel tracking application has been created for learning purposes as a part of an academic project towards our degree- Masters in Business Analytics at Columbia University
,and we obviously had a lot of fun while developing it.
This is a basic web app which helps pinning squirrels on map based on the geographical coordinates of their sightings. 
You can also see squirrel statistics for Central Park, and add as well as modify information about squirrel sighting.
